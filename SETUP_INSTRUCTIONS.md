# MongoDB Setup Instructions for Week 1

## Error: Cannot find module 'mongodb'

If you encounter this error when running your JavaScript files:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'mongodb'
```

It means the MongoDB Node.js driver is not installed in your project. Follow these steps to fix it:

## Step 1: Make sure Node.js is installed

You can check if Node.js is installed by running:

```bash
node --version
```

If not installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 2: Initialize your project (if not done already)

Navigate to your assignment directory and run:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This creates a `package.json` file to manage your project dependencies.

## Step 3: Install the MongoDB driver

Run this command in your assignment directory:

```bash
npm install mongodb
```

## Step 4: Try running your scripts again

After installing the MongoDB driver, you should be able to run your JavaScript files:

```bash
node insert_books.js
```

## Alternative: Using MongoDB Shell

If you prefer not to use Node.js for this assignment, you can use the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) directly:

1. Start your MongoDB server
2. Run your script with MongoDB Shell:
   ```bash
   mongosh --file your_script.js
   ```

Example MongoDB Shell scripts are provided in the examples directory.

## Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues, please:

1. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your system
2. Check that you're in the correct directory when installing packages
3. Verify your MongoDB connection string in your code
